## Overview

An allowlist for NFTs is essentially a roster of wallet addresses that are granted the privilege of minting NFTs before a general release of a collection. There are several means of being added to an allowlist, but the primary one is engaging in an NFT project's community.

This smart contract provides a secure and transparent way to manage whitelist access for minting NFTs.

### Advantages

- **Fair and secure NFT distribution:** Prioritize specific users (e.g., early supporters, community members) by granting them exclusive access to mint NFTs before the public sale.

- **Reduce gas fee:** Reduce transaction fees by limiting initial minting to whitelisted addresses.

- **Increase community engagement:** Encourage participation in community activities or social media engagement as criteria for whitelisting.

- **Transparency and immutability:** All whitelist data is stored on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof records and open visibility.

### Access Control

- Owner of the contract is not able to do CUD (create, update, and delete)
- Owner of the contract is not able to pause the whitelist

### Motiviation

> On LUKSO, users currently get a free monthly quota of 20.000.000 GAS when creating a Universal Profile through the Universal Profile Browser Extension[1].

### Features

- Whitelist management:
  - Add and remove addresses from the whitelist by the whitelist manager.
  - Make pausaable whitelist
- Minting control:
  - Only whitelisted addresses can mint NFTs during the designated mint period.
  - Set limits on the number of NFTs each whitelisted address can mint.
- Security:
  - Access control ensures only authorized manager can manage the whitelist.
  - Re-entrancy attacks are prevented using standard security practices.
