## Introduction
‚ú® This smart contract provides a secure and transparent way to manage whitelist access for minting NFTs.

### Advantages

**Fair and secure NFT distribution:** Prioritize specific users (e.g., early supporters, community members) by granting them exclusive access to mint NFTs before the public sale.

**Reduce gas fee:** Reduce transaction fees by limiting initial minting to whitelisted addresses.

**Increase community engagement:** Encourage participation in community activities or social media engagement as criteria for whitelisting.

**Transparency and immutability:** All whitelist data is stored on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof records and open visibility.
